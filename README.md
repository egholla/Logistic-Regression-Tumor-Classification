# Logistic-Regression-Tumor-Classification
A logistic regression model for classifying tumor malignancy based on medical datasets using python

I used Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to handle the data

I figured this would be a good project to introduce me to statistical models and data handling so it may not be the most impressive or practical, but it was interesting
